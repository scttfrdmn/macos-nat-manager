# macOS NAT Manager

A comprehensive Terminal User Interface (TUI) tool for setting up and managing Network Address Translation (NAT) on macOS. Unlike macOS's built-in Internet Sharing which operates as a bridge, this tool creates true NAT with address translation, providing better privacy and network isolation.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive TUI Interface** - Easy-to-use terminal interface
- üîÄ **True NAT Implementation** - Address translation, not bridging
- üåê **Interface Management** - Select and configure network interfaces
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible Configuration** - Customizable IP ranges and DHCP settings
- üìä **Connection Monitoring** - Real-time view of active connections
- üîß **Clean Setup/Teardown** - Proper cleanup on exit
- üõ°Ô∏è **Network Isolation** - Internal devices hidden from upstream network

## Why Use This Instead of macOS Internet Sharing?

macOS's built-in Internet Sharing operates as a transparent bridge, which means:
- ‚ùå Connected devices' MAC addresses are visible to the upstream network
- ‚ùå Devices can be detected by 802.1x systems
- ‚ùå Less privacy and security

This NAT Manager provides:
- ‚úÖ True NAT with address translation
- ‚úÖ Connected devices are completely hidden
- ‚úÖ Single MAC address visible to upstream network
- ‚úÖ Better privacy and 802.1x compatibility

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+ (for building)
- Homebrew

```

## Usage

### Main Interface

The application presents a menu-driven interface:

```
macOS NAT Manager

üî¥ NAT Inactive

1. Configure Interfaces
2. Configure NAT Settings  
3. Start NAT
4. Monitor Connections
5. Stop NAT

Press number to select, 'q' to quit
```

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Configure Interfaces** (Option 1)
   - Select your external interface (e.g., `en0` for Ethernet, `en1` for WiFi)
   - Select or create an internal interface (e.g., `bridge100`)
   - Press `e` to set external, `i` to set internal

2. **Configure NAT Settings** (Option 2)
   - Set internal network (default: `192.168.100`)
   - Configure DHCP range (default: `192.168.100.100` - `192.168.100.200`)
   - DNS servers are pre-configured (Google DNS)

3. **Start NAT** (Option 3)
   - Enables IP forwarding
   - Creates bridge interface (if needed)
   - Sets up pfctl NAT rules
   - Starts DHCP server

4. **Monitor Connections** (Option 4)
   - View active connections through the NAT
   - Real-time updates every 2 seconds
   - Shows source, destination, protocol, and state

5. **Stop NAT** (Option 5)
   - Clean shutdown of all services
   - Removes NAT rules
   - Destroys created interfaces
   - Stops DHCP server

### Keyboard Shortcuts

## Configuration Details

### Default Settings

- **Internal Network**: `192.168.100.0/24`
- **Gateway**: `192.168.100.1`
- **DHCP Range**: `192.168.100.100` - `192.168.100.200`
- **DHCP Lease**: `12h`
- **DNS Servers**: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`

### Network Topology

```
Internet ‚Üí [External Interface] ‚Üí NAT Router ‚Üí [Internal Interface] ‚Üí Connected Devices
           (en0/en1/etc)         (Your Mac)    (bridge100)          (192.168.100.x)
```

## Technical Details

### What It Does

1. **IP Forwarding**: Enables packet forwarding between interfaces
2. **NAT Rules**: Uses `pfctl` to create NAT translation rules
3. **Bridge Interface**: Creates virtual interface for internal network
4. **DHCP Server**: Runs `dnsmasq` to assign IP addresses
5. **Traffic Translation**: Rewrites packet headers for address translation

### Files Created

- `/tmp/nat_rules.conf` - Temporary pfctl rules file
- DHCP leases managed by dnsmasq

### System Changes

**Temporary (cleaned up on exit):**
- IP forwarding enabled
- pfctl NAT rules loaded
- Bridge interface created
- dnsmasq process running

**None permanent** - All changes are reverted when stopping NAT or exiting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"This tool requires root privileges"**
- Solution: Run with `sudo ./nat-manager`

**"dnsmasq not found"**
- Solution: Install with `brew install dnsmasq`

**"Failed to create bridge interface"**
- Check if interface name is available
- Try different bridge number (bridge101, bridge102, etc.)

**"Failed to load pfctl rules"**
- Check if pfctl is enabled on your system
- Ensure no conflicting firewall rules

**No internet access for connected devices**
- Verify external interface has internet connectivity
- Check NAT rules are properly loaded: `sudo pfctl -s nat`
- Ensure IP forwarding is enabled: `sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check NAT rules
sudo pfctl -s nat

# Check IP forwarding
sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding

# Check DHCP server
ps aux | grep dnsmasq

# Check interfaces
ifconfig

# Check routing table
netstat -rn
```

### Clean Manual Cleanup

If the application exits unexpectedly:

```bash
# Stop NAT
sudo pfctl -d

# Remove bridge interface (adjust number as needed)
sudo ifconfig bridge100 destroy

# Stop DHCP server
sudo killall dnsmasq

# Disable IP forwarding (optional)
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0
```

## Security Considerations

- **Root Privileges**: Required for network configuration
- **Firewall Integration**: Works with pfctl (macOS's built-in firewall)
- **Network Isolation**: Internal devices are NATed, not bridged
- **Clean Shutdown**: Proper cleanup prevents security holes

## Contributing
